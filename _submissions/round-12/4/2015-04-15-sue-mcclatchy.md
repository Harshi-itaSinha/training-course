+I taught the second half of 
+[Tracking Changes](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-changes.html), a novice
+lesson in the git add-commit cycle. I chose this lesson specifically because it helped
+me to understand what git was doing when I issued these commands. The graphics showing
+working files, the staging area, and the repository were particularly helpful. A picture
+is worth a thousand words!
+One of my colleagues found the lesson and the graphics very helpful as well, even though
+he has a better command of git than I do. It's not intuitive.

+Unfortunately there's no audio to accompany the video. I'm not sure why not -
+the mic was not muted. It was the first time I'd used QuickTime to record.
