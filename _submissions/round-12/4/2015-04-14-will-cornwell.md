Here is the video on writing simple for loops in R.  It's pretty basic, but it could fit well into some kind of 
larger lesson like one on processing data from multiple files.  

I have heard from Victor that I should work more on putting informative comments in my code as I go, 
which is a very good suggestion, but hard to implement in short videos.
